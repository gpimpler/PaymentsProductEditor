h2. Rules of the Repository Engagement
* Keep the root level unpolluted. Create a folder to hold logical groupings of work.
* An 'Explore' folder is available to explore ideas without polluting your own directory structure. Please create folders underneath the Explore folder and do not pollute the root of the explore folder.
* Use the conventional SVN structures:
*  trunk - Should contain a stable build of the application at all times
*  branches - A branch should be created from the trunk to implement new feature development
*  tags - *All Production releases MUST* be tagged. Make a tag for any point in time that may be important to the team. It is the *responsibility of your team* to tag your releases as they happen.
